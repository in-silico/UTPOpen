Description:

There are several interesting developments in the history that were
named in honor of their inventors, for example:
- RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.
- BPS is made of the initial letters of Bogomolnyi, Prasad, and Sommerfield.

Sometimes, people change the name of those developments with other words (not necessarily meaningful), for example:

- RSA: Randomized Super Algorithm.
- BPS: Beyond Perturbative States.

In this task you must to check if a name may have come from certain authors, note that the names could be in any order (you can re-organize them).


Input:

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines:

- the name of the autors separated by spaces.
- the name to check separated by spaces.

All the words consist of lowercase english letter.

The number of authors is greater than 1 and less than 10. This number may be different from the number of words in the name to check.

Output:

For each test case print "yes", if the name may have come from the given autors. Print "no" otherwise.

Sample Input:

rivest shamir adleman

bogomolnyi prasad sommerfield
beyond perturbative states
arthur jack sean

Sample Output:

yes
yes
no
