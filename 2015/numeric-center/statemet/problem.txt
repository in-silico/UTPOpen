<P> A numeric center is a number that separates in a consecutive and positive integer number 
list(starting at one) in two groups of consecutive and positive integer numbers, in which 
their sum is the same. The first numeric center is number 6, which takes the list 
$\{1, ~2, ~3, ~4, ~5, ~6, ~7, ~8 \}$ and produces two lists of consecutive and positive integer 
numbers in which their sum (in this case 15) is the same. Those lists are: 
$\{1, ~2, ~3, ~4, ~5\}$ and $\{7, ~8\}$. The second numeric center is 35, that takes the list 
$\{1, ~2, ~3, ~4, ~\ldots, ~49\}$ and produces the following two lists: 
$\{1, ~2, ~3, ~4, ~\ldots, ~34\}$ and $\{36, ~37, ~38, ~39, ~\ldots, ~49\}$ , the sum of each 
list is equal to 395.

<p> The task consists in writing a program that calculates the total of numeric centers between 1 and $n$.



<h3>Input</h3>

<p> The input consists of several test cases. There is only one line for each test case. This line contains a positive integer 
number $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{14}$). The last test case is a value of $n$ equal to zero, this test case should not be processed.



<h3>Output</h3>

<p> For each test case you have to print in one line, the number of numeric centers between 1 and $n$.

<h3>Example</h3>
